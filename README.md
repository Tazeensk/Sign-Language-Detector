# Sign-Language-Detector
## Introduction
The Real-Time Hand Sign Language Detection project aims to develop a system capable of recognizing hand signs in real-time video streams and interpreting them into corresponding letters or words. This project is motivated by the desire to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing impairments by providing an intuitive interface for translating sign language into text or speech.

## Features
- Real-time hand sign detection and interpretation
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy interaction
- Support for capturing video from webcam or video files
- Automatic translation of detected hand signs into text or speech

**Run the GUI application:**
python gui.py
Use the GUI interface to select the video source (webcam or video file) and start real-time hand sign detection.
Interact with the application to see detected hand signs and their interpretations.

**Contributing**
Contributions to the project are welcome! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
